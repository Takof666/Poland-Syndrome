    <h2 id="whatis-title">What is Poland Syndrome?</h2>
    <p id="title-info">Poland syndrome is an asymmetrical syndrome in that it affects one side of the body. The main aspect of Poland Syndrome is an absent chest muscle on one side. Although this can extend to under developed rib cage (on one side) and webbed fingers (or missing digits) on one hand.  The degree of severity of Poland Syndrome and it’s symptoms differs between people but thankfully for the majority of people it is not life threatening. Poland Syndrome is often not diagnosed at all. In fact since the inception of PIP-UK we have come across many stories of people who were well into adulthood before they even knew they had Poland Syndrome. We want to change this situation and so we set up PIP-UK to raise awareness of Poland Syndrome. To get in touch with us drop us a line using our <span id="contact-form">contact form</span>.</p>

        <p id="member2-info"><span id="becca-name">Becca Butcher</span> is a talented content creator, blogger and mental health & body positivity advocate with a large following on Instagram.

The female experience of Poland Syndrome, has for a very long time been under represented.  When Becca was a teenager, there were no other ladies with Poland Syndrome openly talking about their experiences with the condition.  Becca shared her journey with Poland Syndrome on Instagram and blogs which created a community of women with the same condition that Becca is supporting and advocating for. 

Ambassadors help us raise our profile and make an impact. Their support is vital to our campaigning and fundraising work.  Ambassadors help to raise awareness of our work by attending events to talk about Poland Syndrome, the work of the charity and encourage others to get involved.  This is a really important role as it helps us reach more people with Poland Syndrome to raise awareness, inspire new fundraising activity, and thank our supporters for the work they are doing. </p>
